## Musings on WODs

When discussing any topic, it is essential to consider that the biases and experiences that shape your perspective will differ from those of others, and that my opinion expressed here will likely not apply to the broader communityâ€”and may, in fact, be the opposite. However, I will be upfront in saying I did not like the WODs. They are stressful and not particularly useful; it is far better to work on long projects than short, timed coding assignments. The latter will give you a feel for the real world; the former will not. However, I do acknowledge this is me being more strapped for time in a day than anything else.

## Exploring TypeScript, JavaScript, C++, and C

When compared to other programming languages, JavaScript is the most similar. However, this is to be expected simply because TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. A far more fitting comparison would be TypeScript to C++. Both add object-oriented features and type checking while maintaining backwards compatibility with their respective baseline languages. However, it is not a perfect analogy, since C++ is a separate language from C and not merely a superset, unlike TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript.

## TypeScript Through the Lens of Software Engineering

TypeScript, in my opinion, is an ok language from a software engineering perspective. Like all things, it has its pros and cons. It's structured and has built-in type safety. Something that plain old JavaScript lacks, which is a pro. However, it is also more complicated than JavaScript and can be challenging for someone who is not already familiar with JavaScript or a statically typed language to learn. Not only that, but it is also fundamentally limited to JavaScript. However, its biggest flaw is that it's impossible to avoid costly translation from Typescript to JavaScript, especially on a big project, which can slow down development.
